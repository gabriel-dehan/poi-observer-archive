# POI-OBSERVER ARCHIVE

Archive of an old startup project in Ruby On Rails.
Main documentation is, sadly, private on Notion because a lot of information can't be released publicly.

This application was an "observer", tasked with polling our partners API in stead of our users and emitting events to our main API when something happened.
Most of the interesting content are in the jobs / services and the remote models logic.
